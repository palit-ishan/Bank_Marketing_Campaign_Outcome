# Bank_Marketing_Campaign_Outcome

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, 
in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. It is a binary classification problem
and we will be using various Machine Learning Techniques and Algorithms to perform this binary classification.
